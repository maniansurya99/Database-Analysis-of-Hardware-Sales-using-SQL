# Database-Analysis-of-Hardware-Sales-using-SQL

## Introduction
This project involved analyzing and optimizing a sales database for a hardware company using SQL. The database contained around 2 million records collected from a data warehouse. The aim of the project was to generate insights on sales trends, automate sales reports, and optimize the database for efficient supply chain management.

## Tools and Technologies Used
MySQL Workbench
SQL
Stored Procedures
Database Views
Triggers

## Database Analysis
The first step was to analyze the database and generate insights on monthly product transactions, total sales amount, and yearly sales report. This was done by creating SQL queries that extracted relevant data and aggregated it to generate reports. Stored Procedures were then used to automate the monthly gross sales reports and market badges.

Further analysis was conducted by analyzing pre-invoice discount reports, post-invoice discount reports, and net sales reports using database views. Top markets, customers, and products were also identified to identify sales trends.

## Supply Chain Analytics
To optimize supply chain management, supply chain analytics were conducted. A helper table was created to track inventory and a trigger was added to update the inventory in real-time. User accounts and privileges features were implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrated how SQL can be used to analyze and optimize sales databases for efficient supply chain management. The use of Stored Procedures, Database Views, and Triggers helped automate reports and improve data accuracy. The implementation of user accounts and privileges features improved data security.
